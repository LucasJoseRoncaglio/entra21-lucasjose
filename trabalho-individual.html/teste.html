            <p><strong>Pompeii</strong></p>
            <img src="imagen//pompeia-do-alto.jpg">
            <p class="texto">The city of Pompeii is famous because it was destroyed in 79 CE when a nearby volcano,
                Mount Vesuvius, erupted, covering it in at least 19 feet (6 metres) of ash and other volcanic debris.
                The city's quick burial preserved it for centuries before its ruins were discovered in the late 16th
                century..</p>

            <p><strong>Ancient Pisa</strong></p>
            <img src="imagen//pisa.jpg">
            <p class="texto">Ancient Pisa, or Pisae, was possibly inhabited by the Ligurians before passing under Roman
                control as a naval base. It became a Roman colony shortly after 180 bce and by 313 ce had become a
                Christian bishopric. Pisa survived the collapse of the Roman Empire to remain the principal urban centre
                of Tuscany.</p>

            <p><strong>Naples</strong></p>
            <img src="imagen//naples.jpg">
            <p class="texto">Dating back some 4,000 years, Naples is one of the oldest cities in the world. Greek
                settlers established an early colony here about 2,000 BC, and by the 6th century BC they had erected the
                ancient city of Neapolis. The distinct Neapolitan culture was born then and survived even after the
                Romans conquered the area.</p>

            <p><strong>Rome</strong></p>
            <img src="imagen//rome.jpg">
            <p class="texto">As legend has it, Rome was founded in 753 B.C. by Romulus and Remus, twin sons of Mars, the
                god of war. ... Rome's era as a monarchy ended in 509 B.C. with the overthrow of its seventh king,
                Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, whom ancient historians portrayed as cruel and tyrannical, compared to his
                benevolent predecessors.</p>
